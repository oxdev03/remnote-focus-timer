# RemNote Focus Timer

A simple countdown timer for RemNote flashcards that helps you stay focused during review sessions and stop procrastinating by gamifying faster recalls.

## Features

- 🎯 **Card-specific timer**: Uses the RemNote repetition history for the card to calculate target times
- ⏱️ **Smart countdown**: Shows time remaining based on your average performance
- 🎨 **Visual feedback**: Green → Orange → Red as time runs out and shows your response time
- 🎮 **Gamification**: Turn review sessions into a focused challenge against your own times

## How it works

1. Start reviewing flashcards in RemNote
2. Timer automatically starts when a card loads (given the card was reviewed before)
3. Countdown shows your target time (1.2x your average for that card)
4. Timer stops when you reveal the answer
5. Builds better time awareness over multiple sessions

## Display

- **Green**: You're doing well, stay focused
- **Orange**: Getting close to your average time  
- **Red**: Taking longer than usual - try to wrap up

## Settings

- **Target Multiplier**: How much longer than your average to allow (default: 1.2x)
